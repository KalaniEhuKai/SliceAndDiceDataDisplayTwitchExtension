    <h1>Contact the extension developer</h1>
    <p>If you have questions or are interested in contributing (especially if you want to create a better front end!), please post on the <a href="https://github.com/KalaniEhuKai/SliceAndDiceDataDisplayTwitchExtension/discussions">extension's github discussions</a>.</p>
    <p>You can also find and reply to the announcement for the extension in the Slice and Dice discord server (linked from <a href="https://tann.itch.io/slice-dice">here</a>).</p>
    <p>I don't plan to actively work on this after getting an initial version out, but would be thrilled if others want to add more features.  If I don't respond quickly it's because I'm busy, not due to lack of interest.</p>
